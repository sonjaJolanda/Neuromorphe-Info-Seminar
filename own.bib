 abstract = {BACKGROUND

User preference has the potential to facilitate the design, control, and prescription of prostheses, but we do not yet understand which physiological factors drive preference, or if preference is associated with clinical benefits.

METHODS

Subjects with unilateral below-knee amputation walked on a custom variable-stiffness prosthetic ankle and manipulated a dial to determine their preferred prosthetic ankle stiffness at three walking speeds. We evaluated anthropomorphic, metabolic, biomechanical, and performance-based descriptors at stiffness levels surrounding each subject's preferred stiffness.

RESULTS

Subjects preferred lower stiffness values at their self-selected treadmill walking speed, and elected to walk faster overground with ankle stiffness at or above their preferred stiffness. Preferred stiffness maximized the kinematic symmetry between prosthetic and unaffected joints, but was not significantly correlated with body mass or metabolic rate.

CONCLUSION

These results imply that some physiological factors are weighted more heavily when determining preferred stiffness, and that preference may be associated with clinically relevant improvements in gait.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Previous studies of commercially-available trans-tibial prosthetic components have been unable to provide clear insight into the relationships between prosthetic mechanical properties and user performance (i.e., gait quality and energy expenditure), the understanding of which is key to improving prosthesis design and prescription. Many of these studies have been limited by not characterising the mechanical properties of the tested prostheses and/or only considered level walking at self-selected speeds. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic investigation of the effects of ankle rotational stiffness on trans-tibial amputee gait during various walking conditions reflective of those encountered during daily ambulation.

METHODS

Ankle and knee kinematics, prosthetic limb normal ground reaction forces, and net metabolic cost were measured in five traumatic unilateral trans-tibial amputees during treadmill walking on the level, a 5{\%} incline and a 5{\%} decline whilst using an experimental articulated prosthetic foot with four different rotational stiffness setups and without changes in alignment between conditions.

FINDINGS

Overall, lower dorsiflexion stiffness resulted in greater prosthetic side dorsiflexion motion and sound side knee flexion, reduced normal ground reaction force during the loading phase of prosthetic stance and reduced net metabolic cost.

INTERPRETATION

Few differences were observed with changes in plantarflexion stiffness, most likely due to the foot achieving early foot flat. Low dorsiflexion stiffness generally improved gait performance seemingly due to easier tibial progression during stance. However, observed differences were small, suggesting that a wider range of walking and stiffness conditions would be useful to fully explore these effects in future studies.},

@article{Shepherd.2017,
 abstract = {Most commercially available prosthetic feet do not exhibit a biomimetic torque-angle relationship, and are unable to modulate their mechanics to assist with other mobility tasks, such as stairs and ramps. In this paper, we present a quasi-passive ankle-foot prosthesis with a customizable torque-angle curve and an ability to quickly modulate ankle stiffness between tasks. The customizable torque-angle curve is obtained with a cam-based transmission and a fiberglass leaf spring. To achieve variable stiffness, the leaf spring's support conditions can be actively modulated by a small motor, shifting the torque-angle curve to be more or less stiff. We introduce the design, characterize the available torque-angle curves, and present kinematics from a transtibial amputee subject performing level-ground walking, stair ascent/descent, and ramp ascent/descent. The subject exhibited a more normative range of motion on stairs and ramps at lower stiffness levels, and preferred different stiffness levels for each task. Paired with an appropriate intent recognition system, our novel ankle prosthesis could improve gait biomechanics during walking and many other mobility tasks.},

 abstract = {When fitting prosthetic feet, prosthetists fuse information from their visual assessment of patient gait with the patient's communicated perceptions and preferences. In this study, we sought to simultaneously and independently assess patient and prosthetist preference for prosthetic foot stiffness using a custom variable-stiffness prosthesis. In the first part of the experiment, seven subjects with below-knee amputation walked on the variable-stiffness prosthetic foot set to a randomized stiffness, while several prosthetist subjects simultaneously observed their gait. After each trial, the amputee subjects and prosthetist subjects indicated the change to stiffness that they would prefer (increase or decrease). This paradigm allowed us to simultaneously measure amputee subject and prosthetist subject preferences, and provided a reliability index indicating the consistency of their preferences. In the second part of the experiment, amputee subjects were instructed to communicate verbally with one prosthetist subject to arrive at a mutually preferred stiffness. On average, prosthetist subjects preferred a 26{\%} higher stiffness than amputee subjects (p {\textless} 0.001), though this depended on the amputee subject (p {\textless} 0.001). Prosthetist subjects were also considerably less consistent than amputee subjects in their preferences (CV of 5.6{\%} for amputee subjects, CV of 23{\%} for prosthetist subjects; p = 0.014). Mutual preference seemed to be dictated by the specific patient-prosthetist dynamic, and no clear trends emerged.},

@article{Stevens.2018,
 abstract = {INTRODUCTION

This guideline was developed to present current evidence and to provide associated clinical recommendations on prosthetic foot selection for individuals with lower-limb amputation.

MATERIALS

NA.

METHODS

The guideline is based upon the best available evidence as it relates prosthetic foot selection during the provision of definitive lower-limb prostheses. Where possible, recommendations are drawn from Cochrane Review, meta-analysis, systematic and narrative literature reviews, and published evidence-based guidelines. Where this standard is unavailable, alternate academic literature has been used to support individual recommendations.

RESULTS

Recommendation 1: For patients ambulating at a single speed who require greater stability during weight acceptance because of weak knee extensors or poor balance, a single-axis foot should be considered. Recommendation 2: Patients at elevated risks for overuse injury (i.e., osteoarthritis) to the sound-side lower limb and lower back are indicated for an energy-storage-and-return (ESAR) foot to reduce the magnitude of the cyclical vertical impacts experienced during weight acceptance. Recommendation 3: Neither patient age nor amputation etiology should be viewed as primary considerations in prosthetic foot type. Recommendation 4: Patients capable of variable speed and/or community ambulation are indicated for ESAR feet.

CONCLUSIONS

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the available evidence related to prosthetic foot selection for individuals with lower limb amputation. The noted clinical practice guidelines are meant to serve only as {\textquotedbl}guides.{\textquotedbl} They may not apply to all patients and clinical situations.},
